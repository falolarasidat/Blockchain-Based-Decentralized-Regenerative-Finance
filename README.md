# Blockchain-Based Decentralized Regenerative Finance

A comprehensive decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, focused on regenerative finance and positive environmental impact.

## 🌱 Overview

This platform enables transparent, verifiable regenerative finance through blockchain technology, connecting impact investors with verified regenerative projects and communities. The system measures and rewards positive environmental and social outcomes.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Smart Contracts

1. **Entity Verification Contract** (`entity-verification.clar`)
    - Validates regenerative finance institutions
    - Manages verification status and impact scores
    - Maintains registry of verified entities

2. **Impact Investment Contract** (`impact-investment.clar`)
    - Manages regenerative investment flows
    - Handles investment creation and fund release
    - Tracks investment performance and returns

3. **Regenerative Returns Contract** (`regenerative-returns.clar`)
    - Measures positive impact returns
    - Records carbon offset, biodiversity, and community benefits
    - Calculates aggregate impact metrics

4. **Ecosystem Restoration Contract** (`ecosystem-restoration.clar`)
    - Finances ecosystem regeneration projects
    - Manages project milestones and funding releases
    - Tracks restoration progress and outcomes

5. **Community Wealth Contract** (`community-wealth.clar`)
    - Builds regenerative community prosperity
    - Manages community wealth distribution
    - Tracks member contributions and benefits
